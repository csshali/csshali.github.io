title: "New journey as a Ph.D student"
---

I am fortunate to be a Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech from Spring 2022, working in the Experimental and Virtualized Systems (ELVES) Research Lab. My advisor is Dr. Liting Hu, who is currently an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Virginia Tech. 

Our lab conducts Experimental Computer Systems research in the areas of Stream Processing Systems , Cloud and Edge Computing , Distributed Systems , and Operating System Virtualization . Examples include stream processing systems (with Spark Streaming, Storm, Flink), identifying threats (e.g., fake news, rumors, social bots) in online social networks, developing machine learning techniques for systems, container as a service (with Docker and Kubernetes), and resource management in large-scale data centers (with Xen and KVM).
