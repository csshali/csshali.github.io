I am a Ph.D student in the <a href="https://cs.vt.edu/"> Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://vt.edu/">Virginia Tech</a>. 


My research interests lie broadly in the span of machine learning, deep learning and data mining. Particularly, I am interested in: 1) develop effective learning algorithms to tackle the data quality challenges in ML (e.g. data sparsity, class imbalance, outliers, noisy labels, annotation) and for various weakly supervised learning problems (incl. semi-supervised learning, self-supervision, multi-instance learning, transfer learning, contrastive learning, multiple-instance learning, learning from crowds, etc. ); 2) develop reliable learning algorithms for trustworthy machine learning (incl. adversarial machine learning, out-of-distribution detection, open-set recognition, and uncertainty-aware deep learning). My research goals are leveraging ML to influence and accelerate knowledge discovery, addressing problems of scientific and societal relevance and building intelligent systems that augment human intelligence.
