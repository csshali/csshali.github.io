I am a Ph.D student in the <a href="https://cs.vt.edu/"> Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://vt.edu/">Virginia Tech</a>. 


My research interests lie broadly in the span of machine learning, deep learning and data mining. 


My research goals are leveraging ML to influence and accelerate knowledge discovery, addressing problems of scientific and societal relevance and building intelligent systems that assist human intelligence.
